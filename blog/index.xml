      <description>How should I get there? Metro Transit (highly recommended): The green line light rail to the East Bank station is a 0.4 mile walk to Bruininks hall. There are also bus options .
Parking: Nearby ramps are available for $12/day including the Weisman Art Museum Garage , East River Road Garage , and Church Street Garage .
Where should I stay? If you are coming in from out of town, there are many options including staying on a transit line (see above).</description>

      <description>noRth is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our event(s). noRth is a conference intended for professional networking and collaboration in the R community. We encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and thus require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group.
A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice.</description>
